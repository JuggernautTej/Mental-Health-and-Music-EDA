This project explores the effect of music on respondents to a survey and the respondents themselves using R programming. 

 There currently exists the practice of music therapy that uses music as a catalyst to release hormones such as oxytocin to improve an individual's stress levels, mood and overall mental health. By taking a survey online, this project seeks to explore the relationship between music and mental health of the survey respondents across different ages. 
 
This project is based on the work of Catherine Rasgaitis who acquired carried out the survey via a Google Form posted on online (through social media, Reddit forums and Discord servers) and offline (through advertisements in parks, libraries, and other public locations).  The data was accumulated into a database and hosted on her Kaggle page (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results). This served as the source dataset for this project. 
Though Catherine used Python to carryout her own EDA, I used R for my analysis.

## Key Actions Taken
### Data Tranformation
Before loading the csv file into R, I split the Timestamp column into two columns for Date and Time using Excel. 

### Exploration,Data Analysis and Visualization
Below are the questions I sought to answer with my data analyses;
- The scale of the survey
- What the characteristics of the survey respondents were
- What Music platforms were used by respondents and time spent listening
- What relationships exist in the dataset
- The general mental health of the respondents
- What the mental health status of the respondents are based on their musical background
- What were the effects of music on the mental health of respondents
